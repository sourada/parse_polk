###Introduction:
With a digitized old city directory, you can have a computer convert it all to text, organize it into data, and map everything. Many directories have additional information, like peoples professions and business classifications, which is adds very rich data that can ultimately be mined for all sorts of purposes. The idea is to create an open global historic database for MapStory Local that can be mined for all sorts of data, such as demographic and socioeconomic trends, tracking businesses and genealogy. Any privacy must be respected, removing the names of current residents and current phone numbers.

This project is in development, and the options for directories are very limited. Documentation is minimal and will be developed when the project is more established.
